For this assignment I created a website that has the ability to let users vote on products and gives them 25 rounds of voting. They are shown three images and can only choose one from the lineup. The results are shown on the screen after the entire voting round ends. There is both text and a chart that shows the results. Once the browser is releoaded, the site store the information from the previous round.
